# üõ°Ô∏è TXOne Edge IPS Test Suite

This repository contains automated test scripts to evaluate and validate the behavior and effectiveness of **TXOne Edge IPS** under various threat scenarios. These tests are designed for use in controlled OT/ICS lab environments to simulate real-world attack conditions and verify IPS detection and response.

## üìö Test Cases Overview

| Test Case ID | Test Name                     | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| TC-01        | DoS Protection (SYN Flood)     | Simulates a SYN flood attack to verify DoS detection, logging, and mitigation. |
| TC-02        | *(Coming Soon)*                | Example: Protocol Abuse ‚Äì Modbus Scan     |
| TC-03        | *(Coming Soon)*                | Example: Unauthorized File Transfer       |
| TC-04        | *(Coming Soon)*                | Example: L2 MAC Spoofing Detection        |
| ...          | *(More test cases coming)*     |                                           |
